## üìã How to Use

### Encryption Process:

1. Enter your text in the "Enter any text to be Encrypted" field
2. Provide an encryption key in the "Enter Key" field
3. Click the "Encrypt" button
4. The encrypted text will appear in hexadecimal format in the output area

### Decryption Process:

1. Enter the hexadecimal encrypted text in the "Enter the text to Decrypt" field
2. Provide the same key used for encryption in the "Enter Key" field
3. Click the "Decrypt" button
4. The original text will appear in the output area

## üîß Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NeetignaN/encryption.git
   cd encryption
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**

   - Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser
   - No additional dependencies or build process required

3. **For development:**
   - Use any local server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code)
   - Or open directly in browser for basic functionality

## üîç Code Overview

### Encryption Algorithm

The tool uses XOR cipher encryption, which is implemented in `script.js`:

- **XOR Encryption**: Each character is XORed with corresponding key characters
- **Hex Conversion**: Results are converted to hexadecimal for display
- **Key Cycling**: The key repeats if the text is longer than the key

### Key Functions:

- `encrypt()`: Handles the encryption process
- `decrypt()`: Handles the decryption process
- `xorEncrypt(text, key)`: Core encryption algorithm
- `xorDecrypt(hexString, key)`: Core decryption algorithm

## üé® Design Features

- **Cyberpunk Theme**: Green-on-black color scheme with glowing effects
- **Hover Animations**: Interactive elements with scaling and shadow effects
- **Monospace Font**: Source Code Pro for a technical, coding aesthetic
- **Responsive Layout**: Flexbox-based layout for proper alignment

## üîí Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This tool uses XOR cipher, which is suitable for educational purposes and basic obfuscation but should not be used for securing sensitive data in production environments.

**Security Considerations:**

- XOR cipher is vulnerable to frequency analysis
- Key reuse can compromise security
- Not suitable for cryptographically secure applications
- Use strong, random keys for better security
